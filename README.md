# FACE RECOGNITION USING TRANSFORMERS

Python: 3.10

This methodoly is based on: 
- Mediapipe for face detection;
- a backbone based on VGGFace2 and a Transformer to extract features;
- a more specific model for known people;
- mathematical solutions such as cosine similarity to calculate the similarity between faces.

The backbone can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Z53O_5OF3pf2Y3oEQn1hW3f4TLJFB3nH).
